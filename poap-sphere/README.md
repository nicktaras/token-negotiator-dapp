# token-negotiator-dapp
A Dapp to demonstrate the capabilities of using POAP tokens with Token Negotiator

# summary

This is a EthGlobal hackathon entry towards building a tool that can display a users POAP tokens, via an on chain connection.
Then allow the end user to view the tokens inside a sphere and interact with them to read info about the event and remenis of the good times.

The additional feature of this dapp is the ability to connect the tokens to the Token Negotiator. This where an attestation of each token can be created and stored in the browser. 

This scenario would allow for the token to be utilised via Web 2.0 technologies for light attestation, and where full attestation of ownership is required a wallet connection and various checks would be applied using Stormbirdteams technologies.
